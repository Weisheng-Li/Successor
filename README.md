# Successor
The Windows build for my 1-week Unity game project. It's a proof of concept for the core mechanic.

> In this unity game project, I try to create a new cooperation experience. Instead of letting players each control their own characters and play at the same time, I want players to take turns entering the game world, and the decisions each of them make would permanently change the state of the game world and influence the strategies other players take. The inspiration comes from my childhood experience playing video games in friend's house and we switched player everytime someone die. It's a fun and unique experience that allows people to chat and cooperate outside of the game, and I love the social interaction it brings. I think such cooperative experience can motivate players to pay more attention to other peopleâ€™s gaming experience and have more conversation with friends.
